  <h2>Quora Paraphrase Detection</h2>
  <ul>
	<li>Implemented a Bilateral Multi-perspective Matching neural network using PyTorch (Python) and pretrained GloVe word embedding to perform paraphrase detection task. The model takes in two sentences (or phrases) as inputs and predicts whether they are paraphrases of each other or not.</li>
	<li>Evaluated result and compared model with different settings on the Quora question pairs dataset. Tuned hyperparameteres on the validation set and achieved a test accuracy of 88%.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>NYC Crime Data Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Preprocessed and cleaned NYPD Crime dataset from 2015 containing 5.58 million rows and 24 columns of data recording crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006-2015 using Hadoop MapReduce and PySpark.</li>
    <li>Incorporated relevant dataset such as restaurants and weather to develop new metrics to investigate relationship between crime and area. Showcased result using data visualizations such as box plots, bar charts, and geo-location maps from Python libraries and Tableau, compiled with a presentation to tell the stories.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Movie Recommendation System</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented recommendation system algorithms such as matrix factorization with Alternating Least Squares and SGD, and content-based filtering on the Movie Lens dataset in order to recommend movies by predicting users’ ratings from 1 to 5.</li>
    <li>Preprocessed dataset to provide an evaluation scheme for the team by splitting the data into training, validation, and test set while considering their timestamps to model a realistic setting. Achieved RMSE of around 0.91, compared to Netflix’s 0.88.</li>
  </ul>
